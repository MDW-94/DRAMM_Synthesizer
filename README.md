Hello - Matthew
Hi - Melika

A customer has approached DRAM and requested an audio app that will be able to produce sound, that can be altered in real time, through pitch, volume, and set to loop.  
They have also asked that the sound can be recorded and saved.  To be used for playback at a later time.
The app should be able to be run on mobile, as well as provide a background visual effects whilst running to reflect the sound being produced.
